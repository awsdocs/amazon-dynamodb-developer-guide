# NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB<a name="workbench"></a>

NoSQL Workbench for Amazon DynamoDB is a cross\-platform client\-side GUI application for modern database development and operations and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux\. NoSQL Workbench is a unified visual IDE tool that provides data modeling, data visualization, and query development features to help you design, create, query, and manage DynamoDB tables\.

**Data Modeling**  
With NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB, you can build new data models from, or design models based on, existing data models that satisfy your application's data access patterns\. You can also import and export the designed data model at the end of the process\. For more information, see [Building Data Models with NoSQL Workbench](workbench.Modeler.md)\.

**Data Visualization**  
The data model visualizer provides a canvas where you can map queries and visualize the access patterns \(facets\) of the application without having to write code\. Every facet corresponds to a different access pattern in DynamoDB\. You can manually add data to your data model\. For more information, see [Visualizing Data Access Patterns](workbench.Visualizer.md)\.

**Operation Building**  
NoSQL Workbench provides a rich graphical user interface for you to develop and test queries\. You can use the *operation builder* to view, explore, and query datasets\. You can also use the structured operation builder to build and perform data plane operations\. It supports projection and condition expression, and lets you generate sample code in multiple languages\. For more information, see [Exploring Datasets and Building Operations with NoSQL Workbench](workbench.querybuilder.md)\.
