# Core Components of Amazon DynamoDB<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents"></a>

In DynamoDB, tables, items, and attributes are the core components that you work with\. A *table* is a collection of *items*, and each item is a collection of *attributes*\. DynamoDB uses primary keys to uniquely identify each item in a table and secondary indexes to provide more querying flexibility\. You can use DynamoDB Streams to capture data modification events in DynamoDB tables\.

 There are limits in DynamoDB\. For more information, see [Service, Account, and Table Quotas in Amazon DynamoDB](Limits.md)\.

## Tables, Items, and Attributes<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents.TablesItemsAttributes"></a>

The following are the basic DynamoDB components:
+ **Tables** – Similar to other database systems, DynamoDB stores data in tables\. A *table* is a collection of data\. For example, see the example table called *People* that you could use to store personal contact information about friends, family, or anyone else of interest\. You could also have a *Cars* table to store information about vehicles that people drive\.
+ **Items** – Each table contains zero or more items\. An *item* is a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items\. In a *People* table, each item represents a person\. For a *Cars* table, each item represents one vehicle\. Items in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to rows, records, or tuples in other database systems\. In DynamoDB, there is no limit to the number of items you can store in a table\.
+ **Attributes** – Each item is composed of one or more attributes\. An *attribute* is a fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down any further\. For example, an item in a *People* table contains attributes called *PersonID*, *LastName*, *FirstName*, and so on\. For a *Department* table, an item might have attributes such as *DepartmentID*, *Name*, *Manager*, and so on\. Attributes in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to fields or columns in other database systems\.

The following diagram shows a table named *People* with some example items and attributes\.

Note the following about the *People* table:
+ Each item in the table has a unique identifier, or primary key, that distinguishes the item from all of the others in the table\. In the *People* table, the primary key consists of one attribute \(*PersonID*\)\.
+ Other than the primary key, the *People* table is schemaless, which means that neither the attributes nor their data types need to be defined beforehand\. Each item can have its own distinct attributes\.
+ Most of the attributes are *scalar*, which means that they can have only one value\. Strings and numbers are common examples of scalars\.
+ Some of the items have a nested attribute \(*Address*\)\. DynamoDB supports nested attributes up to 32 levels deep\.

The following is another example table named *Music* that you could use to keep track of your music collection\.

Note the following about the *Music* table:
+ The primary key for *Music* consists of two attributes \(*Artist* and *SongTitle*\)\. Each item in the table must have these two attributes\. The combination of *Artist* and *SongTitle* distinguishes each item in the table from all of the others\.
+ Other than the primary key, the *Music* table is schemaless, which means that neither the attributes nor their data types need to be defined beforehand\. Each item can have its own distinct attributes\.
+ One of the items has a nested attribute \(*PromotionInfo*\), which contains other nested attributes\. DynamoDB supports nested attributes up to 32 levels deep\.

## Primary Key<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents.PrimaryKey"></a>

When you create a table, in addition to the table name, you must specify the primary key of the table\. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two items can have the same key\.

DynamoDB supports two different kinds of primary keys:
+ **Partition key** – A simple primary key, composed of one attribute known as the *partition key*\.

  DynamoDB uses the partition key's value as input to an internal hash function\. The output from the hash function determines the partition \(physical storage internal to DynamoDB\) in which the item will be stored\. 

   In a table that has only a partition key, no two items can have the same partition key value\.

  The *People* table described in [Tables, Items, and Attributes](#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.TablesItemsAttributes) is an example of a table with a simple primary key \(*PersonID*\)\. You can access any item in the *People* table directly by providing the *PersonId* value for that item\.
+ **Partition key and sort key** – Referred to as a *composite primary key*, this type of key is composed of two attributes\. The first attribute is the *partition key*, and the second attribute is the *sort key*\.

  DynamoDB uses the partition key value as input to an internal hash function\. The output from the hash function determines the partition \(physical storage internal to DynamoDB\) in which the item will be stored\. All items with the same partition key value are stored together, in sorted order by sort key value\.

  In a table that has a partition key and a sort key, it's possible for two items to have the same partition key value\. However, those two items must have different sort key values\.

  The *Music* table described in [Tables, Items, and Attributes](#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.TablesItemsAttributes) is an example of a table with a composite primary key \(*Artist* and *SongTitle*\)\. You can access any item in the *Music* table directly, if you provide the *Artist* and *SongTitle* values for that item\.

  A composite primary key gives you additional flexibility when querying data\. For example, if you provide only the value for *Artist*, DynamoDB retrieves all of the songs by that artist\. To retrieve only a subset of songs by a particular artist, you can provide a value for *Artist* along with a range of values for *SongTitle*\.

**Note**  
The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*\. The term *hash attribute* derives from the use of an internal hash function in DynamoDB that evenly distributes data items across partitions, based on their partition key values\.  
The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*\. The term *range attribute* derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value\.

Each primary key attribute must be a scalar \(meaning that it can hold only a single value\)\. The only data types allowed for primary key attributes are string, number, or binary\. There are no such restrictions for other, non\-key attributes\.

## Secondary Indexes<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents.SecondaryIndexes"></a>

You can create one or more secondary indexes on a table\. A *secondary index* lets you query the data in the table using an alternate key, in addition to queries against the primary key\. DynamoDB doesn't require that you use indexes, but they give your applications more flexibility when querying your data\. After you create a secondary index on a table, you can read data from the index in much the same way as you do from the table\.

DynamoDB supports two kinds of indexes:
+ Global secondary index – An index with a partition key and sort key that can be different from those on the table\.
+ Local secondary index – An index that has the same partition key as the table, but a different sort key\.

Each table in DynamoDB has a quota of 20 global secondary indexes \(default quota\) and 5 local secondary indexes per table\.

In the example *Music* table shown previously, you can query data items by *Artist* \(partition key\) or by *Artist* and *SongTitle* \(partition key and sort key\)\. What if you also wanted to query the data by *Genre* and *AlbumTitle*? To do this, you could create an index on *Genre* and *AlbumTitle*, and then query the index in much the same way as you'd query the *Artist* and *SongTitle* index\.

The following diagram shows the example *Music* table, with a new index called *GenreAlbumTitle*\. In the index, *Genre* is the partition key and *AlbumTitle* is the sort key\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/HowItWorksGenreAlbumTitle.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/)

Note the following about the *GenreAlbumTitle* index:
+ Every index belongs to a table, which is called the *base table* for the index\. In the preceding example, *Music* is the base table for the *GenreAlbumTitle* index\.
+ DynamoDB maintains indexes automatically\. When you add, update, or delete an item in the base table, DynamoDB adds, updates, or deletes the corresponding item in any indexes that belong to that table\.
+ When you create an index, you specify which attributes will be copied, or *projected*, from the base table to the index\. At a minimum, DynamoDB projects the key attributes from the base table into the index\. This is the case with `GenreAlbumTitle`, where only the key attributes from the `Music` table are projected into the index\.

You can query the *GenreAlbumTitle* index to find all albums of a particular genre \(for example, all *Rock* albums\)\. You can also query the index to find all albums within a particular genre that have certain album titles \(for example, all *Country* albums with titles that start with the letter H\)\.

## DynamoDB Streams<a name="HowItWorks.CoreComponents.Streams"></a>

DynamoDB Streams is an optional feature that captures data modification events in DynamoDB tables\. The data about these events appear in the stream in near\-real time, and in the order that the events occurred\.

Each event is represented by a *stream record*\. If you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record whenever one of the following events occurs:
+ A new item is added to the table: The stream captures an image of the entire item, including all of its attributes\.
+ An item is updated: The stream captures the "before" and "after" image of any attributes that were modified in the item\.
+ An item is deleted from the table: The stream captures an image of the entire item before it was deleted\.

Each stream record also contains the name of the table, the event timestamp, and other metadata\. Stream records have a lifetime of 24 hours; after that, they are automatically removed from the stream\.

You can use DynamoDB Streams together with AWS Lambda to create a *trigger*—code that runs automatically whenever an event of interest appears in a stream\. For example, consider a *Customers* table that contains customer information for a company\. Suppose that you want to send a "welcome" email to each new customer\. You could enable a stream on that table, and then associate the stream with a Lambda function\. The Lambda function would run whenever a new stream record appears, but only process new items added to the *Customers* table\. For any item that has an `EmailAddress` attribute, the Lambda function would invoke Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\) to send an email to that address\.

**Note**  
In this example, the last customer, Craig Roe, will not receive an email because he doesn't have an `EmailAddress`\.

In addition to triggers, DynamoDB Streams enables powerful solutions such as data replication within and across AWS Regions, materialized views of data in DynamoDB tables, data analysis using Kinesis materialized views, and much more\.
