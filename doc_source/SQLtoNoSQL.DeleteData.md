# Deleting Data from a Table<a name="SQLtoNoSQL.DeleteData"></a>

In SQL, the `DELETE` statement removes one or more rows from a table\. Amazon DynamoDB uses the `DeleteItem` operation to delete one item at a time\.

## SQL<a name="SQLtoNoSQL.DeleteData.SQL"></a>

In SQL, you use the `DELETE` statement to delete one or more rows\. The `WHERE` clause determines the rows that you want to modify\. The following is an example.

```
DELETE FROM Music
WHERE Artist = 'The Acme Band' AND SongTitle = 'Look Out, World';
```

You can modify the `WHERE` clause to delete multiple rows\. For example, you could delete all of the songs by a particular artist, as shown in the following example.

```
DELETE FROM Music WHERE Artist = 'The Acme Band'
```

**Note**  
If you omit the `WHERE` clause, the database attempts to delete all of the rows from the table\.

## DynamoDB<a name="SQLtoNoSQL.DeleteData.DynamoDB"></a>

In DynamoDB, you use the `DeleteItem` action to delete data from a table, one item at a time\. You must specify the item's primary key values\.

```
{
    TableName: "Music",
    Key: {
        Artist: "The Acme Band", 
        SongTitle: "Look Out, World"
    }
}
```

**Note**  
In addition to `DeleteItem`, DynamoDB supports a `BatchWriteItem` action for deleting multiple items at the same time\.

`DeleteItem` supports *conditional writes*, where the operation succeeds only if a specific `ConditionExpression` evaluates to true\. For example, the following `DeleteItem` action deletes the item only if it has a *RecordLabel* attribute.

```
{
    TableName: "Music",
    Key: {
        Artist: "The Acme Band", 
        SongTitle: "Look Out, World"
    },
   ConditionExpression: "attribute_exists(RecordLabel)"
}
```

**Note**
