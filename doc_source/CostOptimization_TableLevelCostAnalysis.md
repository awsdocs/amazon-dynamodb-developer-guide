# Evaluate your costs at the table level<a name="CostOptimization_TableLevelCostAnalysis"></a>

 The Cost Explorer tool found within the AWS Management Console allows you to see costs broken down by type, such as read, write, storage and backup charges\. You can also see these costs summarized by period such as month or day\.

One challenge administrators can face is when the costs of only one particular table need to be reviewed\. Some of this data is available via the DynamoDB console or via calls to the `DescribeTable` API, however Cost Explorer does not, by default, allow you to filter or group by costs associated with a specific table\. This section will show you how to use tagging to perform individual table cost analysis in Cost Explorer\.

## How to view the costs of a single DynamoDB table<a name="CostOptimization_TableLevelCostAnalysis_ViewInfo"></a>

Both the Amazon DynamoDB AWS Management Console and the `DescribeTable` API will show you information about a single table, including the primary key schema, any indexes on the table, and the size and item count of the table and any indexes\. The size of the table, plus the size of the indexes, can be used to calculate the monthly storage cost for your table\. For example, $0\.25 per GB in the us\-east\-1 region\.

If the table is in provisioned capacity mode, the current RCU and WCU settings are returned as well\. These could be used to calculate the current read and write costs for the table, but these costs could change, especially if the table has been configured with Auto Scaling\.

**Note**  
If the table is in on\-demand capacity mode, then `DescribeTable` will not help estimate throughput costs, as these are billed based on actual, not provisioned usage in any one period\.

## Cost Explorer's default view<a name="CostOptimization_TableLevelCostAnalysis_CostExplorer"></a>

Cost Explorer's default view provides charts showing the cost of consumed resources such as throughput and storage\. You can choose to group costs by period, such as totals by month or by day\. The costs of storage, reads, writes, and other features can be broken out and compared as well\.

## How to use and apply table tags in Cost Explorer<a name="CostOptimization_TableLevelCostAnalysis_Tagging"></a>

By default, Cost Explorer does not provide a summary of the costs for any one specific table, as it will combine the costs of multiple tables into a total\. However, you can use [AWS resource tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) to identify each table by a metadata tag\. Tags are key\-value pairs you can use for a variety of purposes, such as to identify all resrouces belonging to a project or department\. For this example, we'll assume you have a table named **MyTable**\.

1. Set a tag with the key of **table\_name** and the value of **MyTable**\.

1. [Activate the tag within Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html) and then filter on the tag value to gain more visibility into each table's costs\.

**Note**  
It may take one or two days for the tag to start appearing in Cost Explorer

You can set metadata tags yourself in the console, or via automation such as the AWS CLI or AWS SDK\. Consider requiring a **table\_name** tag to be set as part of your organizationâ€™s new table creation process\. For existing tables, there is a Python utility available that will find and apply these tags to all existing tables in a certain region in your account\. See [Eponymous Table Tagger on GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-dynamodb-tools#eponymous-table-tagger-tool) for more details\.
