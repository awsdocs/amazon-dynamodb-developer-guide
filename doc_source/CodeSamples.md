# Running the Code Samples in This Developer Guide<a name="CodeSamples"></a>

The AWS SDKs provide broad support for Amazon DynamoDB in [ Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java), [JavaScript in the browser](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-browser), [\.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net), [Node\.js](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js), [PHP](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php), [Python](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python), [Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby), [C\+\+](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp), [Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go), [Android](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/), and [iOS](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/)\. To get started quickly with these languages, see [Getting Started with DynamoDB](GettingStarted.md)\.

The code samples in this Developer Guide provide more in\-depth coverage of DynamoDB operations, using the following programming languages:
+ [Java Code Samples](CodeSamples.Java.md)
+ [\.NET Code Samples](CodeSamples.DotNet.md)

Before you can begin with this exercise, you need to sign up for AWS, get your access key and secret key, and set up the AWS Command Line Interface on your computer\. See [Setting Up DynamoDB \(Web Service\)](SettingUp.DynamoWebService.md)\.

**Note**  
If you are using the downloadable version of DynamoDB, you need to use the AWS CLI to create the tables and sample data\. You also need to specify the `--endpoint-url` parameter with each AWS CLI command\. For more information, see [Setting the Local Endpoint](DynamoDBLocal.Endpoint.md)\.
