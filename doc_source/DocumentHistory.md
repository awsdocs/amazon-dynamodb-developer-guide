## Earlier updates<a name="WhatsNew.earlier-updates"></a>

The following table describes important changes of the *DynamoDB Developer Guide* before July 3, 2018\.


****  

| Change | Description | Date Changed | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Go support for DAX |  Now, you can enable microsecond read performance for Amazon DynamoDB tables in your applications written in the Go programming language by using the new DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\) SDK for Go\. For more information, see [DAX SDK for Go](DAX.client.run-application-go.md)\.  | June 26, 2018 | 
| DynamoDB announces SLA |  DynamoDB has released a public availability SLA\. For more information, see [Amazon DynamoDB Service Level Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/sla/)\.  | June 19, 2018 | 
| DynamoDB continuous backups and Point\-In\-Time Recovery \(PITR\)  |  Point\-in\-time recovery helps protect your Amazon DynamoDB tables from accidental write or delete operations\. With point in time recovery, you don't have to worry about creating, maintaining, or scheduling on\-demand backups\. For example, suppose that a test script writes accidentally to a production DynamoDB table\. With point\-in\-time recovery, you can restore that table to any point in time during the last 35 days\. DynamoDB maintains incremental backups of your table\. For more information, see [Point\-in\-time recovery for DynamoDB](PointInTimeRecovery.md)\.  | April 25, 2018 | 
| Encryption at rest for DynamoDB |  DynamoDB encryption at rest, available for new DynamoDB tables, helps you secure your application data in Amazon DynamoDB tables by using AWS\-managed encryption keys stored in AWS Key Management Service\. For more information, see [DynamoDB encryption at rest](EncryptionAtRest.md)\.  | February 8, 2018 | 
| DynamoDB Backup and restore |  On\-Demand Backup allows you to create full backups of your DynamoDB tables data for data archival, helping you meet your corporate and governmental regulatory requirements\. You can backup tables from a few megabytes to hundreds of terabytes of data, with no impact on performance and availability to your production applications\. For more information, see [Using On\-Demand backup and restore for DynamoDB](BackupRestore.md)\.  | November 29, 2017 | 
| DynamoDB Global tables |  Global Tables builds upon DynamoDB’s global footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi\-region, and multi\-active database that provides fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications\. Global Tables replicates your Amazon DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS regions\. For more information, see [Global tables \- multi\-Region replication for DynamoDB](GlobalTables.md)\.  | November 29, 2017 | 
| Node\.js support for DAX |  Node\.js developers can leverage DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\), using the DAX client for Node\.js\. For more information, see [In\-memory acceleration with DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\)](DAX.md)\.  | October 5, 2017 | 
| VPC Endpoints for DynamoDB |  DynamoDB endpoints allow Amazon EC2 instances in your Amazon VPC to access DynamoDB, without exposure to the public Internet\. Network traffic between your VPC and DynamoDB does not leave the Amazon network\. For more information, see [Using Amazon VPC endpoints to access DynamoDB](vpc-endpoints-dynamodb.md)\.  | August 16, 2017 | 
| Auto Scaling for DynamoDB |  DynamoDB auto scaling eliminates the need for manually defining or adjust provisioned throughput settings\. Instead, DynamoDB auto scaling dynamically adjusts read and write capacity in response to actual traffic patterns\. This allows a table or a global secondary index to increase its provisioned read and write capacity to handle sudden increases in traffic, without throttling\. When the workload decreases, DynamoDB auto scaling decreases the provisioned capacity\. For more information, see [Managing throughput capacity automatically with DynamoDB auto scaling](AutoScaling.md)\.  | June 14, 2017 | 
| DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\) |  DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\) is a fully managed, highly available, in\-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement – from milliseconds to microseconds – even at millions of requests per second\. For more information, see [In\-memory acceleration with DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\)](DAX.md)\.  | April 19, 2017 | 
| DynamoDB now supports automatic item expiration with Time to Live \(TTL\) |   Amazon DynamoDB Time to Live \(TTL\) enables you to automatically delete expired items from your tables, at no additional cost\. For more information, see [Expiring items by using DynamoDB Time to Live \(TTL\)](TTL.md)\.  | Feb 27, 2017 | 
| DynamoDB now supports Cost Allocation Tags |   You can now add tags to your Amazon DynamoDB tables for improved usage categorization and more granular cost reporting\. For more information, see [Adding tags and labels to resources](Tagging.md)\.  | Jan 19, 2017 | 
| New DynamoDB DescribeLimits API |  The `DescribeLimits` API returns the current provisioned capacity limits for your AWS account in a region, both for the region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there\. It lets you determine what your current account\-level limits are so that you can compare them to the provisioned capacity that you are currently using, and have plenty of time to apply for an increase before you hit a limit\. For more information, see [Service, account, and table quotas in Amazon DynamoDB](ServiceQuotas.md) and the [DescribeLimits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLimits.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB API Reference*\.  | March 1, 2016 | 
| DynamoDB Console Update and New Terminology for Primary Key Attributes |  The DynamoDB management console has been redesigned to be more intuitive and easy to use\. As part of this update, we are introducing new terminology for primary key attributes: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DocumentHistory.html) Only the names have changed; the functionality remains the same\. When you create a table or a secondary index, you can choose either a simple primary key \(partition key only\), or a composite primary key \(partition key and sort key\)\. The DynamoDB documentation has been updated to reflect these changes\. | November 12, 2015 | 
| Amazon DynamoDB Storage Backend for Titan | The DynamoDB Storage Backend for Titan is a storage backend for the Titan graph database implemented on top of Amazon DynamoDB\. When using the DynamoDB Storage Backend for Titan, your data benefits from the protection of DynamoDB, which runs across Amazon’s high\-availability data centers\. The plugin is available for Titan version 0\.4\.4 \(primarily for compatibility with existing applications\) and Titan version 0\.5\.4 \(recommended for new applications\)\. Like other storage backends for Titan, this plugin supports the Tinkerpop stack \(versions 2\.4 and 2\.5\), including the Blueprints API and the Gremlin shell\. For more information, see [Amazon DynamoDB Storage Backend for Titan](Tools.TitanDB.md)\. | August 20, 2015 | 
| DynamoDB Streams, Cross\-Region Replication, and Scan with Strongly Consistent Reads | DynamoDB Streams captures a time\-ordered sequence of item\-level modifications in any DynamoDB table, and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours\. Applications can access this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near real time\. For more information, see [Change data capture for DynamoDB Streams](Streams.md) and the [DynamoDB Streams API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)\. DynamoDB cross\-region replication is a client\-side solution for maintaining identical copies of DynamoDB tables across different AWS regions, in near real time\. You can use cross region replication to back up DynamoDB tables, or to provide low\-latency access to data where users are geographically distributed\. The DynamoDB `Scan` operation uses eventually consistent reads, by default\. You can use strongly consistent reads instead by setting the `ConsistentRead` parameter to true\. For more information, see [Read consistency for scan](Scan.md#Scan.ReadConsistency) and [Scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Scan.html) in the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference\. | July 16, 2015 | 
| AWS CloudTrail support for Amazon DynamoDB | DynamoDB is now integrated with CloudTrail\. CloudTrail captures API calls made from the DynamoDB console or from the DynamoDB API and tracks them in log files\. For more information, see [Logging DynamoDB operations by using AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md) and the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\. | May 28, 2015 | 
| Improved support for Query expressions | This release adds a new KeyConditionExpression parameter to the Query API\. A Query reads items from a table or an index using primary key values\. The KeyConditionExpression parameter is a string that identifies primary key names, and conditions to be applied to the key values; the Query retrieves only those items that satisfy the expression\. The syntax of KeyConditionExpression is similar to that of other expression parameters in DynamoDB, and allows you to define substitution variables for names and values within the expression\. For more information, see [Query operations in DynamoDB](Query.md)\. | April 27, 2015 | 
| New comparison functions for conditional writes | In DynamoDB, the ConditionExpression parameter determines whether a PutItem, UpdateItem, or DeleteItem succeeds: The item is written only if the condition evaluates to true\. This release adds two new functions, attribute\_type and size, for use withConditionExpression\. These functions allow you to perform a conditional writes based on the data type or size of an attribute in a table\. For more information, see [Condition expressions](Expressions.ConditionExpressions.md)\. | April 27, 2015 | 
| Scan API for secondary indexes | In DynamoDB, a Scan operation reads all of the items in a table, applies user\-defined filtering criteria, and returns the selected data items to the application\. This same capability is now available for secondary indexes too\. To scan a local secondary index or a global secondary index, you specify the index name and the name of its parent table\. By default, an index Scan returns all of the data in the index; you can use a filter expression to narrow the results that are returned to the application\. For more information, see [Working with scans in DynamoDB](Scan.md)\. | February 10, 2015 | 
| Online operations for global secondary indexes | Online indexing lets you add or remove global secondary indexes on existing tables\. With online indexing, you do not need to define all of a table's indexes when you create a table; instead, you can add a new index at any time\. Similarly, if you decide you no longer need an index, you can remove it at any time\. Online indexing operations are non\-blocking, so that the table remains available for read and write activity while indexes are being added or removed\. For more information, see [Managing Global Secondary Indexes](GSI.OnlineOps.md)\. | January 27, 2015 | 
| Document model support with JSON | DynamoDB allows you to store and retrieve documents with full support for document models\. New data types are fully compatible with the JSON standard and allow you to nest document elements within one another\. You can use document path dereference operators to read and write individual elements, without having to retrieve the entire document\. This release also introduces new expression parameters for specifying projections, conditions and update actions when reading or writing data items\. To learn more about document model support with JSON, see [Data types](HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.md#HowItWorks.DataTypes) and [Using expressions in DynamoDB](Expressions.md)\. | October 7, 2014 | 
| Flexible scaling | For tables and global secondary indexes, you can increase provisioned read and write throughput capacity by any amount, provided that you stay within your per\-table and per\-account limits\. For more information, see [Service, account, and table quotas in Amazon DynamoDB](ServiceQuotas.md)\. | October 7, 2014 | 
| Larger item sizes | The maximum item size in DynamoDB has increased from 64 KB to 400 KB\. For more information, see [Service, account, and table quotas in Amazon DynamoDB](ServiceQuotas.md)\.  | October 7, 2014 | 
| Improved conditional expressions | DynamoDB expands the operators that are available for conditional expressions, giving you additional flexibility for conditional puts, updates, and deletes\. The newly available operators let you check whether an attribute does or does not exist, is greater than or less than a particular value, is between two values, begins with certain characters, and much more\. DynamoDB also provides an optional OR operator for evaluating multiple conditions\. By default, multiple conditions in an expression are ANDed together, so the expression is true only if all of its conditions are true\. If you specify OR instead, the expression is true if one or more one conditions are true\. For more information, see [Working with items and attributes](WorkingWithItems.md)\. | April 24, 2014 | 
| Query filter | The DynamoDB Query API supports a new QueryFilter option\. By default, a Query finds items that match a specific partition key value and an optional sort key condition\. A Query filter applies conditional expressions to other, non\-key attributes; if a Query filter is present, then items that do not match the filter conditions are discarded before the Query results are returned to the application\. For more information, see [Query operations in DynamoDB](Query.md)\. | April 24, 2014 | 
| Data export and import using the AWS Management Console | The DynamoDB console has been enhanced to simplify exports and imports of data in DynamoDB tables\. With just a few clicks, you can set up an AWS Data Pipeline to orchestrate the workflow, and an Amazon Elastic MapReduce cluster to copy data from DynamoDB tables to an Amazon S3 bucket, or vice\-versa\. You can perform an export or import one time only, or set up a daily export job\. You can even perform cross\-region exports and imports, copying DynamoDB data from a table in one AWS region to a table in another AWS region\. For more information, see [Exporting and importing DynamoDB data using AWS Data Pipeline](DynamoDBPipeline.md)\.  | March 6, 2014 | 
| Reorganized higher\-level API documentation | Information about the following APIs is now easier to find: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DocumentHistory.html)These higher\-level APIs are now documented here: [Higher\-level programming interfaces for DynamoDB](HigherLevelInterfaces.md)\. | January 20, 2014 | 
| Global secondary indexes | DynamoDB adds support for global secondary indexes\. As with a local secondary index, you define a global secondary index by using an alternate key from a table and then issuing Query requests on the index\. Unlike a local secondary index, the partition key for the global secondary index does not have to be the same as that of the table; it can be any scalar attribute from the table\. The sort key is optional and can also be any scalar table attribute\. A global secondary index also has its own provisioned throughput settings, which are separate from those of the parent table\. For more information, see [Improving data access with secondary indexes](SecondaryIndexes.md) and [Using Global Secondary Indexes in DynamoDB](GSI.md)\. | December 12, 2013 | 
| Fine\-grained access control | DynamoDB adds support for fine\-grained access control\. This feature allows customers to specify which principals \(users, groups, or roles\) can access individual items and attributes in a DynamoDB table or secondary index\. Applications can also leverage web identity federation to offload the task of user authentication to a third\-party identity provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon\. In this way, applications \(including mobile apps\) can handle very large numbers of users, while ensuring that no one can access DynamoDB data items unless they are authorized to do so\. For more information, see [Using IAM policy conditions for fine\-grained access control](specifying-conditions.md)\. | October 29, 2013 | 
| 4 KB read capacity unit size | The capacity unit size for reads has increased from 1 KB to 4 KB\. This enhancement can reduce the number of provisioned read capacity units required for many applications\. For example, prior to this release, reading a 10 KB item would consume 10 read capacity units; now that same 10 KB read would consume only 3 units \(10 KB / 4 KB, rounded up to the next 4 KB boundary\)\. For more information, see [Read/write capacity mode](HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.md)\. | May 14, 2013 | 
| Parallel scans | DynamoDB adds support for parallel Scan operations\. Applications can now divide a table into logical segments and scan all of the segments simultaneously\. This feature reduces the time required for a Scan to complete, and fully utilizes a table's provisioned read capacity\. For more information, see [Working with scans in DynamoDB](Scan.md)\. | May 14, 2013 | 
| Local secondary indexes | DynamoDB adds support for local secondary indexes\. You can define sort key indexes on non\-key attributes, and then use these indexes in Query requests\. With local secondary indexes, applications can efficiently retrieve data items across multiple dimensions\. For more information, see [Local Secondary Indexes](LSI.md)\. | April 18, 2013 | 
| New API version | With this release, DynamoDB introduces a new API version \(2012\-08\-10\)\. The previous API version \(2011\-12\-05\) is still supported for backward compatibility with existing applications\. New applications should use the new API version 2012\-08\-10\. We recommend that you migrate your existing applications to API version 2012\-08\-10, since new DynamoDB features \(such as local secondary indexes\) will not be backported to the previous API version\. For more information on API version 2012\-08\-10, see the [Amazon DynamoDB API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/)\. | April 18, 2013 | 
| IAM policy variable support |  The IAM access policy language now supports variables\. When a policy is evaluated, any policy variables are replaced with values that are supplied by context\-based information from the authenticated user's session\. You can use policy variables to define general purpose policies without explicitly listing all the components of the policy\. For more information about policy variables, go to [Policy Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html) in the *AWS Identity and Access Management Using IAM* guide\.  For examples of policy variables in DynamoDB, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon DynamoDB](security-iam.md)\.   | April 4, 2013  | 
| PHP code examples updated for AWS SDK for PHP version 2 | Version 2 of the AWS SDK for PHP is now available\. The PHP code examples in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide have been updated to use this new SDK\. For more information on Version 2 of the SDK, see [AWS SDK for PHP](https://aws.amazon.com/sdkforphp)\. | January 23, 2013 |

|  Best practices documentation  |  The Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide identifies best practices for working with tables and items, along with recommendations for query and scan operations\.  |  September 28, 2012  | 
|  Support for binary data type  |  In addition to the Number and String types, DynamoDB now supports Binary data type\.  Prior to this release, to store binary data, you converted your binary data into string format and stored it in DynamoDB\. In addition to the required conversion work on the client\-side, the conversion often increased the size of the data item requiring more storage and potentially additional provisioned throughput capacity\.  With the binary type attributes you can now store any binary data, for example compressed data, encrypted data, and images\. For more information see [Data types](HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.md#HowItWorks.DataTypes)\. For working examples of handling binary type data using the AWS SDKs, see the following sections: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DocumentHistory.html) For the added binary data type support in the AWS SDKs, you will need to download the latest SDKs and you might also need to update any existing applications\. For information about downloading the AWS SDKs, see [\.NET code examples](CodeSamples.DotNet.md)\.  |  August 21, 2012  | 
|  DynamoDB table items can be updated and copied using the DynamoDB console  |  DynamoDB users can now update and copy table items using the DynamoDB Console, in addition to being able to add and delete items\.
