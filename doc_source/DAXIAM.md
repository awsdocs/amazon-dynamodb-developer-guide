# Identity and access management in DynamoDB Accelerator<a name="DAXIAM"></a>

DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\) is designed to work together with DynamoDB, to seamlessly add a caching layer to your applications\. However, DAX and DynamoDB have separate access control mechanisms\. Both services use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to implement their respective security policies, but the security models for DAX and DynamoDB are different\.
