# Table Classes<a name="HowItWorks.TableClasses"></a>

DynamoDB offers two table classes designed to help you optimize for cost\. The DynamoDB Standard table class is the default, and is recommended for the vast majority of workloads\. The DynamoDB Standard\-Infrequent Access \(DynamoDB Standard\-IA\) table class is optimized for tables where storage is the dominant cost\. For example, tables that store infrequently accessed data, such as application logs, old social media posts, e\-commerce order history, and past gaming achievements, are good candidates for the Standard\-IA table class\. See [Amazon DynamoDB Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand/) for pricing details\.

Every DynamoDB table is associated with a table class \(DynamoDB Standard by default\)\. Each table class offers different pricing for data storage as well as for read and write requests\. You can select the most cost\-effective table class for your table based on its storage and throughput usage patterns\.

The choice of a table class is not permanent—you can change this setting using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK\. DynamoDB also supports managing your table class using AWS CloudFormation for single\-Region tables \(tables that are not global tables\)\. To learn more about selecting your table class, see [Considerations When Choosing a Table Class](WorkingWithTables.tableclasses.md)\.
