# Step 5: Query Data in a Table<a name="getting-started-step-5"></a>

In this step, you query the data that you wrote to the `Music` table in [Step 2: Write Data to a Table Using the Console or AWS CLI](getting-started-step-2.md) by specifying `Artist`\. This will display all songs that are associated with the partition key: `Artist`\.

For more information about query operations, see [Working with Queries in DynamoDB](Query.md)\. 

To create a global secondary index for your table, proceed to [Step 6: Create a Global Secondary Index](getting-started-step-6.md)\.
