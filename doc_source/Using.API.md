 You can use the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface to work interactively with Amazon DynamoDB\. However, to get the most out of DynamoDB, you can write application code using the AWS SDKs\.

The AWS SDKs provide broad support for DynamoDB in [ Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java), [JavaScript in the browser](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-browser), [\.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net), [Node\.js](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js), [PHP](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php), [Python](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python), [Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby), [C\+\+](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp), [Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go), [Android](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/), and [iOS](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk/)\. To get started quickly with these languages, see [Getting started with DynamoDB and the AWS SDKs](GettingStarted.md)\.

Before you can use the AWS SDKs with DynamoDB, you must get an AWS access key ID and secret access key\. For more information, see [Setting up DynamoDB \(web service\)](SettingUp.DynamoWebService.md)\. 

 For a high\-level overview of DynamoDB application programming with the AWS SDKs, see [Programming with DynamoDB and the AWS SDKs](Programming.md)\.
