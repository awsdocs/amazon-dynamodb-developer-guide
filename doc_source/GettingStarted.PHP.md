# PHP and DynamoDB<a name="GettingStarted.PHP"></a>

In this tutorial, you use the AWS SDK for PHP to write simple programs to perform the following Amazon DynamoDB operations:
+ Create a table called `Movies` and load sample data in JSON format\.
+ Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on the table\.
+ Run simple queries\.

As you work through this tutorial, you can refer to the [AWS SDK for PHP Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/guide/)\. The [Amazon DynamoDB section](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/api-dynamodb-2012-08-10.html) in the *AWS SDK for PHP API Reference* describes the parameters and results for DynamoDB operations\.
