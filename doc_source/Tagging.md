# Adding tags and labels to resources<a name="Tagging"></a>

You can label Amazon DynamoDB resources using *tags*\. Tags let you categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria\. Tags can help you do the following:
+ Quickly identify a resource based on the tags that you assigned to it\.
+ See AWS bills broken down by tags\.
**Note**  
Any local secondary indexes \(LSI\) and global secondary indexes \(GSI\) related to tagged tables are labeled with the same tags automatically\. Currently, DynamoDB Streams usage cannot be tagged\.

Tagging is supported by AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, DynamoDB, and more\. Efficient tagging can provide cost insights by enabling you to create reports across services that carry a specific tag\.

To get started with tagging, do the following:

1. Understand [Tagging restrictions in DynamoDB](TaggingRestrictions.md)\.

1. Create tags by using [Tagging resources in DynamoDB](Tagging.Operations.md)\.

1. Use [Cost allocation reports](CostAllocationReports.md) to track your AWS costs per active tag\.

Finally, it is good practice to follow optimal tagging strategies\. For information, see [AWS tagging strategies](https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Tagging_Strategies.pdf)\.
