# Ruby and DynamoDB<a name="GettingStarted.Ruby"></a>

In this tutorial, you use the AWS SDK for Ruby to write simple programs to perform the following Amazon DynamoDB operations:
+ Create a table called `Movies` and load sample data in JSON format\.
+ Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on the table\.
+ Run simple queries\.

As you work through this tutorial, you can refer to the [AWS SDK for Ruby API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/index.html)\. The [DynamoDB section](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/DynamoDB.html) describes the parameters and results for DynamoDB operations\.

## Tutorial Prerequisites<a name="GettingStarted.Ruby.Prereqs"></a>
+ Download and run DynamoDB on your computer\. For more information, see [Setting Up DynamoDB Local \(Downloadable Version\)](DynamoDBLocal.md)\. 
**Note**  
You use the downloadable version of DynamoDB in this tutorial\. For information about how to run the same code against the DynamoDB web service, see the [Summary](GettingStarted.Ruby.Summary.md)\.
+ Set up an AWS access key to use the AWS SDKs\. For more information, see [Setting Up DynamoDB \(Web Service\)](SettingUp.DynamoWebService.md)\.
+ Set up the AWS SDK for Ruby:
  + Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)\.
  + Install the [AWS SDK for Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/)\.
