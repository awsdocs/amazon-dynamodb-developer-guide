# Using the Console<a name="ConsoleDynamoDB"></a>

You can use the [Amazon DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home) to do the following in DynamoDB:
+ Monitor recent alerts, total capacity, service health, and the latest DynamoDB news on the DynamoDB dashboard\. 
+ Create, update, and delete tables\. The capacity calculator provides estimates of how many capacity units to request based on the usage information you provide\.
+ Manage streams\.
+ View, add, update, and delete items that are stored in tables\. Manage Time To Live \(TTL\) to define when items in a table expire so that they can be deleted automatically from the database\.
+ Query and scan a table\.
+ Set up and view alarms to monitor your table's capacity usage\. View your table's top monitoring metrics on real\-time graphs from Amazon CloudWatch\.
+ Modify a table's provisioned capacity\.
+ Create and delete global secondary indexes\.
+ Create triggers to connect streams to AWS Lambda functions\.
+ Apply tags to your resources to help organize and identify them\.
+ Purchase reserved capacity\.

The console displays an introductory screen that prompts you to create your first table\. To view your tables, from the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Tables**\.

 Here's a high\-level overview of the actions available per table within each navigation tab:
+ **Overview** – View stream and table details, and manage streams and Time To Live \(TTL\)\.
+ **Items** – Manage items and perform queries and scans\.
+ **Metrics** – Monitor CloudWatch metrics\.
+ **Alarms** – Manage CloudWatch alarms\.
+ **Capacity** – Modify a table's provisioned capacity\.
+ **Indexes** – Manage global secondary indexes\.
+ **Backups** – Create, restore, and delete table backups.
+ **Triggers** – Manage triggers to connect DynamoDB streams to Lambda functions\.
+ **Access control** – Set up fine\-grained access control with web identity federation\.
+ **Tags** – Apply tags to your resources to help organize and identify them\.
