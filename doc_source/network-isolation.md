# Infrastructure Security in Amazon DynamoDB<a name="network-isolation"></a>

As a managed service, Amazon DynamoDB is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

You use AWS published API calls to access DynamoDB through the network\. Clients must support TLS \(Transport Layer Security\) 1\.0\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Diffie\-Hellman Ephemeral \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\. Additionally, requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

 You can also use a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) endpoint for DynamoDB to enable Amazon EC2 instances in your VPC to use their private IP addresses to access DynamoDB with no exposure to the public internet\. For more information, see [Using Amazon VPC Endpoints to Access DynamoDB](vpc-endpoints-dynamodb.md)\.
